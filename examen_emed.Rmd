This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within tdata:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABIAAAASCAYAAABWzo5XAAAAbElEQVR4Xs2RQQrAMAgEfZgf7W9LAguybljJpR3wEse5JOL3ZObDb4x1loDhHbBOFU6i2Ddnw2KNiXcdAXygJlwE8OFVBHDgKrLgSInN4WMe9iXiqIVsTMjH7z/GhNTEibOxQswcYIWYOR/zAjBJfiXh3jZ6AAAAAElFTkSuQmCChe chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}

A <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,3),ncol = 3)
solve(A)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
